\opening{Dear Members of the Admission Committee,}

I was Qiao Wang's immediate superior throughout his career at TP-LINK Technologies CO., LTD. We have known each other for more than three years since he joined the company, and I am confident that he will be a competitive post-graduate student based on his performance in the company.

He who does not agree with others easily is a man of critical thinking. Aside from his job well done, the most impressive part on him is his thirst for knowledge. In one of his projects, he was in charge of the development of a Windows-based software for RF evaluation. Besides completed his own business, he also started to study 802.11 protocols and fixed some wireless bugs during test period. He is a person who is never satisfied with superficial understanding of science and technology and wants to dig it up and up.

Qiao is an initiative man knowing how and where to learn, every time he learns new knowledge, he would test it through experiment. During his induction training, he did experiments of ARP, NAT and so on to test the theoretical knowledge. He is just not satisfied with learning knowledge well, but also wants to figure out how to apply it. Whatâ€™s more, during his part time, he is really active at Github and other forums and is on the frontier of technology. He also acquires knowledge through online courses and meetings or technical seminars.

The working performance of Qiao Wang is outstanding: his critical thinking, own initiative, algorithm background as well as programming skill, would make him a competitive graduate student. I hereby unequivocally recommend him to your graduate program.

\closing{Sincerely,}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
